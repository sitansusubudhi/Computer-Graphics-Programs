      Something useful: in order to draw the line, you must set a
	 	 	series of individual pixels. You can do this
	 	 	by making a call to the setPixel method of the
	 	 	Grid object. In other words, the command
	 	 	         view.setPixel(3,4); 
			would turn the pixel at position (3, 4) black.


      NOTE: If you want to have any auxiliary methods (helpers), you
	    must make sure to declare them "static" as well.
